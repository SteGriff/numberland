# Numberland

Instructions:

+ Drag blocks into the mirror to make a clone
+ They need to be "standing tall" to fit in the mirror
+ Drag one block on top of another to stack them (add)
+ It's not currently possible to "split" blocks again (subtract)
+ If you run out of "Ones" you can click the sun to get another one.
+ Right-click a block to change its width, up to a max of five (not available on touch screens)
+ When combined, blocks get the greater width of either block that was combined
+ Have fun!
